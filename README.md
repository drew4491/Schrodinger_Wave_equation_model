This shows the 1D and 2D models of the Shrodinger Wave Equation. All the code files are explained at the bottom of the PDF.

## Schrödinger Wave Equation

The Schrödinger Wave simulation is shown with a potential well, potential wall, and also models the double-slit experiment. For this, we had to manipulate the input values, or initial conditions, to see how the model was affected. If the initial conditions / boundary conditions didn't make sense, the output also did not make any sense typically having the wave function just spread out into nothing with no real interpretation being gathered from it. If the conditions were right, it is possible to see how the potential well and potential wall contain or reflect the waveform.  The double-slit experiment shows how the wave function passes through the two slits and behaves like a wave/particle with the well known quantum mechanical pattern demonstrated after passing through the slits.
